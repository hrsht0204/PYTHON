# Hand Gesture Recognition with MediaPipe

This project uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect hand gestures in real-time using a webcam. It specifically detects the "Victory" sign (index and middle fingers forming a "V") and saves the image when the gesture is recognized.

## Features:
- Detects hand gestures using MediaPipe.
- Recognizes the "Victory" sign (index and middle fingers forming a "V").
- Saves an image of the detected gesture to a specified folder.
- Displays the number of raised fingers on the screen.
